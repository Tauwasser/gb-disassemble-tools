# Tools to help disassemble Game Boy games #

WIP python code to partly disassemble Game Boy games.

Simple disassembler like [pokemon-reverse-engineering-tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pret/pokemon-reverse-engineering-tools) don't include any internal representation.
I hope to eventually be able to run simple algorithms on the parsed graph to figure out data locations etc.
